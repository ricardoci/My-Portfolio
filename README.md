# My-Portfolio


## Description



I built this project to put into work the skills that the bootcamp has taught me so far. This bootcamp was built to continue to practice my skills and so that I can provide recruiters with some of my projects. This helps recruiters and companies look at a a series of projects that I have built. It shows comapnies some of the skills that I have. I learned many new properties and ways to set up my sections. Websites look very easy to the eye but it is a different story when you are the one developeing them.
